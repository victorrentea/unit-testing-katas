## Unit Testing Katas

This project contains a series of coding exercises 
to work out your unit testing skills and practice the features of Mockito.

The exercises:
1. Calculator - unit-testing logic, no mocks
2. Trip Service - mocks
3. Diagnostic - mocks
4. Nuclear Service - heavy mocks

To learn Mockito features by example, please check the MockitoShowcaseTest class.

For extra difficulty, try to run mvn test and then look in /target/pit-reports/index.html
for a report on how well you tested the target code.
