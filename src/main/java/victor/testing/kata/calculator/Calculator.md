# Unit Testing Existing Code
## Purpose
Practice writing unit tests

**This assignment can be done individually or in Pair Programming.**

## Goal
Test each individual requirement on the existing code.

### Requirements
- The Add method can take 0, 1, or 2 numbers and will return their sum.
- An empty string will return 0.
- Example inputs: `“”, “1”, or “1,2”`
- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string. Then 1 number. Then 2 numbers.
- The Add method can handle an unknown number of arguments/numbers.
- The Add method can handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
    1. Example: `“1\n2,3”` should return 6.
    2. Example: `“1,\n”` is invalid, but you don’t need a test for this case.
    3. Only test correct inputs – there is no need to deal with invalid inputs for this kata.
- Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “Negatives not allowed: “ listing all negative numbers that were in the list of numbers.
    1. Example `“-1,2”` throws “Negatives not allowed: -1”
    2. Example `“2,-4,3,-5”` throws “Negatives not allowed: -4,-5”
- Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored.
    * Example: `“1001,2”` returns 2
- The Add method can handle a different delimiter:
    1. To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: `“//[delimiter]\n[numbers]”`
    2. Example: `“//;\n1;2”` should return 3 (the delimiter is ;)
    3. This first line is optional; all existing scenarios (using , or \n) should work as before.


### TDD Variation
If you are more experienced in writing unit tests, try to delete the Calculator.java
and implement it from scratch one feature after the other, writing the unit test before the implementation (Test-Driven Development)
