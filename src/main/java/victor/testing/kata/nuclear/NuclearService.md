# Unit Testing with Mocks - Level 2
## Purpose
Practice writing unit tests on existing code by introducing mocks to decouple unwanted dependencies.

**This assignment can be done individually or in Pair Programming.**

## Goal
Make sure every line in NuclearService class is unit tested. It's a very critical piece of code that we plan to improve, 
although the other classes around it won't probably change in the near future.

A pretty good check is running the unit tests with coverage analysis and seeing all lines are green (covered)

## Tips:
If you need a refresh on how to use mocks, or you don't know a certain feature (eg mocking static methods),
first read carefully MockitoShowcaseTest.
